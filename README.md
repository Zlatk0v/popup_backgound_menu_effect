# Circle Background Effect

## Overview

The **Circle Background Effect** is a visual enhancement designed for the popup burger menu in a WordPress site. This effect creates an animated circle that expands and fades down, providing an engaging background for the menu when it is opened. The animation adds a dynamic touch to the user interface, improving the overall user experience.

## Description
### Global Styles:

body, html: Placeholder for any additional styles that might be applied to the body or html elements. This can be expanded if needed.
### Circle Styles:

Positioning: The circle is positioned absolutely at the center of the viewport.
Dimensions: The width and height of the circle are set to 700px, creating a large circle effect.
Color: The background color of the circle is set to #995258.
Border Radius: border-radius: 50% creates a perfect circle shape.
Transform: The circle is centered using transform: translate(-50%, -50%).
Animation: Two animations are applied:
fadeDown: (Not defined in the provided CSS but should be included elsewhere if needed).
expandCircle: This animation scales the circle from its initial size to nine times its original size over a duration of 1 second, with a delay of 0.5 seconds before starting.

## Usage

Include the HTML: Copy the content of the circle <div> into the desired location in your WordPress popup menu.

Include the CSS: Add the provided CSS to your theme's stylesheet or a custom CSS section in your WordPress admin panel.

Animation Integration: Ensure that the animation starts when the burger menu is activated. This can be achieved using JavaScript or CSS classes toggled by your menu interaction.
